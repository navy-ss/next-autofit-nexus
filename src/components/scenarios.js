        title: "Process is an ideal fit for automation",
        description: "The process is defined, frequently repeated, stable, and well-aligned with strategic goals. Data is structured, system access is compatible, and automation promises significant benefits. ROI is favourable with minimal risks. Refer to the ROI Calculator for detailed cost savings."

        title: "Process is a good fit with minor adjustments needed",
        description: "The process is mostly defined and repeated but needs minor adjustments. It may face occasional changes and high demand. Data is mostly structured, and system access is generally appropriate. Strategic alignment is strong, but ROI requires further analysis. Risks are manageable."

        title: "Process can be automated but needs redesign and system modifications for smooth deployment",
        description: "The process needs significant customization due to ambiguities and irregularities. It involves frequent changes and high demand. Data is partially structured, and system access is inconsistent. Strategic alignment and ROI need careful evaluation due to higher costs and risks."

        title: "Process is not a good fit for automation",
        description: "The process lacks clear definition and regularity, with frequent changes and high demand. Data is unstructured, and system access is inadequate. It does not align well with strategic goals and has high implementation costs and risks. Automation is currently unsuitable."

        title: "Process needs further exploration",
        description: "Key details about the process, such as step definition and data structure, are unclear. Further investigation is needed to assess alignment with strategic goals, benefits, and ROI. Risks and compliance issues also require more detailed review. Please get in touch with Indegeneâ€™s Intelligent Automation team for further exploration on this process."
